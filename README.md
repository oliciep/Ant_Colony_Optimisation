# Ant Colony Optimisation

This project is a Python based ant colony optimisation algorithm that tackles the travelling salesman problem. I implemented a solution that utilises pheromone based 'ants' that travel along nodes depositing pheromones, upon 1000 iterations. The end goal finds the best fitness possible.
## Results
Here,
- _e_ = Pheromone strength coefficient
- _m_ = Number of nodes

## Features

- Python based backend implementation of ACO.
- Parameter based testing with variable inputs of _e_ and _m_.
- Graph based solution utilising nodes and edges.
- Pheromone and fitness implemented to imitate ants behaviour.
